# IOS_Scrumdinger_APP_DEV_Demo

Using Xcode, SwiftUI, and UIKit to develop a mobile app that helps users manage their daily scrums. 

In this process, I created a user interface for Scrumdinger with the basic building blocks of SwiftUI. I modified views, and refine the appâ€™s accessibility a ccording to the scrum activities. 

In the future process, I will be learning about common language patterns of the view hierarchy for Scrumdinger and display the contents of a collection. I will also learn about how to build a navigation hierarchy and present a modal view with its own navigation stack.
